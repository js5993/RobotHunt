# RobotHunt

This is my first serious Android app.

The initial version of the project was done for an assignment for SFU CMPT 276 class during Spring 2018 semester.

I have extended the work with additional content, mainly by continuing to study the
Android Big Nerd Ranch textbook.

The improvements done to the project since Spring, include:
1) The project now uses fragments for UI code, not activities. This conforms to the AUF (Always Use Fragments) principle.
2) The project now has a scoreboard so that the users can store their prior performance.
3) The project now has music.
4) The project now has sound effects when the game is won.
5) There has been some code refactoring.
6) A new background has been added.
