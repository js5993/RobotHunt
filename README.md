# RobotHunt

This project was the first serious android app I have done.

The initial version of the project was done for an assignment for SFU CMPT 276 class.

I have extended the work with additional content

I have since done such improvements to the project, including:

1) ported the project to use fragments instead of activities, conforming to the AUF principle.

2) added score keeping so that the users store their prior performance.

3) added music that plays while playing the game.

4) added music that plays when the game is won.

5) code refactorings.

6) new background.
