# RobotHunt

This is my first serious Android app.

The initial version of the project was done for an assignment for SFU CMPT 276 class during Spring 2018 semester.

I have extended the work with additional content, mainly by continuing to study the
Android Big Nerd Ranch textbook.

The improvements done to the project, include:

1) ported the project to use fragments instead of activities, conforming to the AUF principle.

2) added score keeping so that the users store their prior performance.

3) added music that plays while playing the game.

4) added music that plays when the game is won.

5) code refactorings.

6) new background.

#TODO 

1. Improve the alignment of widgets in portrait mode, or if not possible, then set orientation permanently to landscape.

2. Fill in the help section. Possibly with this README.

3. Change the music to something more appropriate.

4. Change the game setting selection to a proper menu. Or maybe even use a Dialogue fragment.
